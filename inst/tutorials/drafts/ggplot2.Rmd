We're going to be using 

```{r prepare-MovieData, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
```

Use the code block below to explore the `MovieData` dataset by clicking on the **Run Code** button. Use the `str()` and `glimpse()` functions.


```{r MovieData, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-MovieData"}
# print MovieData below
MovieData
```


## Initialize the plot

We're going to start by visualizing the `rating` variable using a `geom_histogram()`

Initialize the plot with `ggplot2` and assign this output to `base_layer`

```{r prepare-MovieData-base-layer, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
```

```{r MovieData-base-layer, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-MovieData-base-layer", fig.width = 6}
# initialize the plot and save as base_layer
base_layer <- MovieData %>% 
    ggplot()
# print base_layer
```

## Map aesthetics

We can see `base_layer` is a nice, blank, canvas. We'll add the `rating` column to the `x` aesthetic. 

```{r prepare-MovieData-x-layer, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
# MovieData ----
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
# base_layer ----
base_layer <- MovieData %>% 
    ggplot()
```

```{r MovieData-x-layer, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-MovieData-x-layer", fig.width = 6}
x_layer <- base_layer + 
    aes(x = rating)
# print x_layer
```

We can see the `x` axis is scaled to the `rating` variable because the numbers along the bottom match the `range()` of the values in `rating`. 

```{r prepare-MovieData-rating-range, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
# MovieData ----
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
```

```{r MovieData-rating-range, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-MovieData-rating-range"}
# use range() to get the minimum and maximum values for MovieData$rating
range()
```

## Add layers with `+`

We're going to add a `geom_histogram()` layer and **labels**:

```{r prepare-geom_histogram-layer, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
# MovieData ----
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
# base_layer ----
base_layer <- MovieData %>% 
    ggplot()
# x_layer ----
x_layer <- base_layer + 
    aes(x = rating)
```

Use the code below to create your labels: 

```{r labs_histogram, eval=FALSE}
labs_histogram <- labs(
        title = "Distribution of average IMDB user rating",
        subtitle = "Data from ggplot2movies (http://imdb.com/)", 
        caption = "made with geom_histogram()",
        x = "IMDB Rating", 
        y = "Count")
```

Add a `geom_histogram()` and `labs_histogram` to `x_layer` using plus symbols (`+`).

```{r geom_histogram-layer, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-geom_histogram-layer"}
# paste 'labs_histogram' code below:

x_layer + 
    # <- add geom_histogram() to x_layer here
    # <- add labs_histogram layer here (don't forget '+' above!)
```

The distribution for `rating` looks nearly [normal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution), but we can get a better look at this distribution with a box-plot. 

## Using geoms

In the previous exercise we added a `geom_histogram()` layer. One of the many useful aspects of the `ggplot2` syntax is the ability to change your graph completely by just swapping geom functions (this is whats meant by *infinitely extensible*).

```{r prepare-geom_boxplot-layer, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
# MovieData ----
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
# base_layer ----
base_layer <- MovieData %>% 
    ggplot()
# x_layer ----
x_layer <- base_layer + 
    aes(x = rating)
```

Use the code below to create your box-plot labels:

```{r labs_boxplot_rating, eval=FALSE}
labs_boxplot_rating <- labs(
        title = "Distribution of average IMDB user rating",
        subtitle = "Data from ggplot2movies (http://imdb.com/)",
        caption = "made with geom_boxplot()",
        x = "IMDB Rating")
```

```{r geom_boxplot-layer, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-geom_boxplot-layer"}
# paste 'labs_boxplot_rating' code below:

x_layer + 
    # <- add geom_boxplot() to x_layer here
    # <- add labs_boxplot_rating layer here
```

The vertical line in the center of the box-plot graph tells us the median (or middle) value for the `rating` variable. The left-hand edge of the box (called the lower hinge) is the first quartile (or 25th percentile), and the right-hand edge of the box (called the upper hinge) is the third quartile (or 75th percentile). Think of these 'higher' and 'lower' values for `rating`.

The lines extending horizontally from the box are called 'whiskers', and these represent the 'low' and 'high' values in `rating` (not the minimum and maximum though!). 

The points on the far-left hand side of the box-plot (beyond the whiskers) are called 'outliers' because they're *much lower* (or higher) than the other values for `rating`.

## Summary statistics

We can confirm the numbers in the box-plot by passing ` MovieData$rating` to  `skimr::skim()`:

```{r prepare-skimr-rating, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
# MovieData ----
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
```

```{r skimr-rating, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-skimr-rating"}
# pass MovieData$rating to skimr::skim()
skimr::skim()
```

The median IMDB rating is a good measure of the 'middle' of this variable. We can see from the `skim()` output above that this value is `6.1` (as `p50`). The box-plot confirms this, as well as the 25th and 75th percentile (as `p25` and `p75`) in the lower and upper hinges (`5.2` and `6.9`). 

Click on **Run Code** below to compare the box-plot to the `skimr` output we created above:

```{r prepare-ggp_boxplot_rating-skim, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
# MovieData ----
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
# base_layer ----
base_layer <- MovieData %>% 
    ggplot()
# x_layer ----
x_layer <- base_layer + 
    aes(x = rating) 
# labels
labs_boxplot_rating <- labs(
        title = "Distribution of average IMDB user rating",
        subtitle = "Data from ggplot2movies (http://imdb.com/)",
        caption = "made with geom_boxplot()",
        x = "IMDB Rating", 
        y = "")
# boxplot ----
ggp_boxplot_rating <- x_layer + 
    geom_boxplot() + # <- add geom_boxplot() to x_layer here
    labs_boxplot_rating # <- add labs_boxplot_rating layer here
```

```{r ggp_boxplot_rating-skim, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-ggp_boxplot_rating-skim"}
# print ggp_boxplot_rating below


```

Learn more about box-plots in this great [medium post](https://medium.com/dayem-siddiqui/understanding-and-interpreting-box-plots-d07aab9d1b6c). 

We can also use `dplyr::select()` to view both the `length` and `rating` variables from `MovieData` with the `skim()` function.

```{r prepare-MovieData-length-rating-skim, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
MovieData <- mutate(MovieData, mpaa = factor(mpaa, 
                                levels = c("PG", "PG-13", "R"), 
                                labels = c("PG", "PG-13", "R")))
```

Click **Run Code** and view the results:

```{r MovieData-length-rating-skim, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-MovieData-length-rating-skim"}
MovieData %>% 
    dplyr::select(length, rating) %>% 
    skimr::skim()
```

We can see the median movie length is around 90 minutes long, the shortest movie is 7 minutes, and the longest movie is 251 minutes.

Now we're going to confirm the summary statistics for `length` with a box-plot. 

## Checking our expectations

Use the code below to create a box-plot of `length` so we can get a better understanding of this variables distribution. 

```{r labs_boxplot_length, eval=FALSE}
labs_boxplot_length <- labs(
        title = "Average IMDB user rating by MPAA Rating",
        subtitle = "Data from ggplot2movies (http://imdb.com/)",
        caption = "made with geom_boxplot()",
        x = "Movie length (in minutes)")
```

```{r prepare-MovieData-length-boxplot, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
MovieData <- mutate(MovieData, mpaa = factor(mpaa, 
                                levels = c("PG", "PG-13", "R"), 
                                labels = c("PG", "PG-13", "R")))
```

```{r MovieData-length-boxplot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-MovieData-length-boxplot"}
# paste labs_boxplot_length code below: 

# initialize the plot
MovieData %>% ggplot() + 
    # add length to the x
    aes(x = ) + 
    # add geom_boxplot
    
    # add labels
    
```

Based on what we saw in the `skim()` output, does the box-plot match our expectations?

## Numeric vs. categorical relationships

Box-plots are also great because they take up less room than histograms or density plots, which means we can see how a continuous variable like `rating` is distributed across a categorical variable (like `mpaa`). 

```{r prepare-MovieData-mpaa-skim, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
MovieData <- mutate(MovieData, mpaa = factor(mpaa, 
                                levels = c("PG", "PG-13", "R"), 
                                labels = c("PG", "PG-13", "R")))
```

First we're going to use `group_by()` from `dplyr` to view the summary statistics for `rating` by `mpaa`. 

```{r MovieData-mpaa-skim, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-MovieData-mpaa-skim"}
MovieData %>% 
    group_by( ) %>% # add mpaa to the group_by() function
    skim(rating)
```

We can see the output from `skim` tells us the median (`p50`) IMDB rating across the three levels of `mpaa` are `PG` = `5.7`, `PG-13` = `6`, and `R` = `6.2`. 

We'll use the code below to build a box-plot of the mpaa and rating variables. 

First, create the labels: 

```{r labs_boxplot_mpaa_rating, eval=FALSE}
labs_boxplot_mpaa_rating <- labs(
        title = "Average IMDB user rating by MPAA Rating",
        subtitle = "Data from ggplot2movies (http://imdb.com/)",
        caption = "made with geom_boxplot()",
        x = "IMDB Rating", 
        y = "MPAA Rating")
```

The code below initializes the plot and maps the aesthetics. Add the  `geom_boxplot()` layer and the labels.

```{r prepare-MovieData-rating-mpaa-geom_boxplot, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
MovieData <- mutate(MovieData, mpaa = factor(mpaa, 
                                levels = c("PG", "PG-13", "R"), 
                                labels = c("PG", "PG-13", "R")))
```

```{r MovieData-rating-mpaa-geom_boxplot, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-MovieData-rating-mpaa-geom_boxplot"}
# paste labs_boxplot_mpaa_rating code below: 

# initialize the plot
MovieData %>% ggplot() + 
    # add aesthetics
    aes(x = rating, y = mpaa) + 
    # add geom_boxplot
    
    # add labels
    
```

*How would you describe the relationship between IMDB ratings and MPAA ratings?*

We can see the position of the box moves (i.e. the rating gets more positive) across the three levels of `mpaa`.

Now we're going to graph two numerical variables: `length` and `rating`. 

## Numeric vs. numeric relationships 

```{r prepare-MovieData-geom-point, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
MovieData <- mutate(MovieData, mpaa = factor(mpaa, 
                                levels = c("PG", "PG-13", "R"), 
                                labels = c("PG", "PG-13", "R")))
```

We're going to plot `rating` as a function of `length`. Both of these variables are numeric, and we've explored their summary statistics using the `skim()` function and box-plots. 

Now we're going to plot both columns using a `geom_point()` (scatter-plot) to see if there is a sweet spot where movies aren't too long or too short. First we'll build the labels for the graph and store these in `labs_point_rating_length`. 

```{r labs_point_rating_length, eval=FALSE}
labs_point_rating_length <- labs(
        title = "Average IMDB user rating by movie length",
        subtitle = "Data from ggplot2movies (http://imdb.com/)",
        caption = "made with geom_point()",
        x = "Movie length (in minutes)",
        y = "Average IMDB User Rating")
```

Add the `geom_point()` layer and `labs_point_rating_length` labels and store the graph in `ggp_length_rating`:

```{r MovieData-geom-point, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-MovieData-geom-point"}
# paste labs_point_rating_length code below: 

# initialize the plot
ggp_length_rating <- MovieData %>% ggplot() + 
    # add length to the x
    aes(x = length, y = rating) + 
    # add geom_point
    
    # add labels

# print the ggp_length_rating plot below
```

*How would you describe the relationship between movie length and IMDB ratings?*

We've looked at the relationship between movie length and average IMDB rating, and there doesn't seem to be a strong relationship. 

If there was a strong relationship between been, the points would look more like the data below:

```{r prepare-CorrData08, include=FALSE}
CorrData08 <- vroom::vroom("https://bit.ly/3DFPp4X", delim = ",")
labs_corr08 <- labs(
        title = "Average IMDB user rating by movie length",
        subtitle = "Simulated correlation = 0.8",
        caption = "made with geom_point()",
        x = "Movie length (in minutes)",
        y = "Average IMDB User Rating")

ggp_corr08_data <- CorrData08 %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = length, y = rating)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    labs_corr08
```

```{r CorrData08, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-CorrData08"}
ggp_corr08_data
```

The strength of a relationship is measured with the correlation coefficient (r), and it ranges from −1 - 1. The graph above shows a correlation of `0.8`, which is strong. As we can see, as `length` goes up, so does `rating`. 

The graph below shows a correlation of `0.6`. As we can see, the spread of the data isn't as tight (it looks more like a football). It's harder to say that length and rating go up (or down) together.  

```{r prepare-CorrData06, include=FALSE}
CorrData06 <- vroom::vroom("https://bit.ly/3x4rFoy", delim = ",")
labs_corr06 <- labs(
        title = "Average IMDB user rating by movie length",
        subtitle = "Simulated correlation = 0.6",
        caption = "made with geom_point()",
        x = "Movie length (in minutes)",
        y = "Average IMDB User Rating")

ggp_corr06_data <- CorrData06 %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = length, y = rating)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    labs_corr06
```

```{r CorrData06, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-CorrData06"}
ggp_corr06_data
```

The plot below shows a weak correlation (`0.4`), and this looks almost identical to the `ggp_length_rating` plot. 

```{r prepare-CorrData04, include=FALSE}
CorrData04 <- vroom::vroom("https://bit.ly/3HDhtZc", delim = ",")
labs_corr04 <- labs(
        title = "Average IMDB user rating by movie length",
        subtitle = "Simulated correlation = 0.6",
        caption = "made with geom_point()",
        x = "Movie length (in minutes)",
        y = "Average IMDB User Rating")
ggp_corr04_data <- CorrData04 %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = length, y = rating)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    labs_corr04
```

```{r cor-CorrData04, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-CorrData04"}
ggp_corr04_data
```

## Using color

We've created a scatter-plot of `length` and `rating`, but what if we want to add another variable to the relationship, like `mpaa`? 

We can use `color` to differentiate between the mpaa ratings by mapping the color aesthetic in the `geom_point()`. 

First we build the labels for the new plot:

```{r labs_point_rating_length_mpaa, eval=FALSE}
labs_point_rating_length_mpaa <- labs(
        title = "Average IMDB user rating by movie length and MPAA rating",
        subtitle = "Data from ggplot2movies (http://imdb.com/)",
        caption = "made with geom_point()",
        x = "Movie length (in minutes)",
        y = "Average IMDB User Rating", 
        color = "MPAA rating")
```

```{r prepare-MovieData-map-color, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
```

Add the `mpaa` variable to `geom_point()`, but be sure and place it *inside* the `aes()` function:

```{r MovieData-map-color, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-MovieData-map-color"}
# create the labels 
labs_point_rating_length_mpaa <- 
# create scatter-plot
MovieData %>% 
    # map length and rating
    ggplot(aes(x = length, y = rating)) + 
    geom_point(aes(color = )) + # add color aesthetic 
     # add labels 
     
    # does adding color help explain the relationship?
```

A lot of the points on this graph are stacked on top of each other (called over-plotting), so we will add the `alpha` argument to `geom_point()` to adjust the opacity of each point. 

```{r prepare-MovieData-alpha, include=FALSE}
source("https://bit.ly/3c6DfGe")
MovieData <- create_movie_data()
MovieData <- filter(MovieData, !is.na(budget))
labs_point_rating_length_mpaa <- labs(
        title = "Average IMDB user rating by movie length and MPAA rating",
        subtitle = "Data from ggplot2movies (http://imdb.com/)",
        caption = "made with geom_point()",
        x = "Movie length (in minutes)",
        y = "Average IMDB User Rating", 
        color = "MPAA rating")
```

The labels are available as `labs_point_rating_length_mpaa`.

```{r MovieData-alpha, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-MovieData-alpha"}
# create scatter-plot
MovieData %>% 
    # map length and rating
    ggplot(aes(x = length, y = rating)) + 
    geom_point(aes(color = mpaa), alpha = ) + # add alpha as 1/3 
     # add labels (labs_point_rating_length_mpaa)
    
    # did the alpha improve the visibility of the points?
```
