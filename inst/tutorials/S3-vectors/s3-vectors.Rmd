## An Overview of S3 Vectors 

S3 vectors include factors, dates, datetimes, difftimes. As the quote above states, the underlying foundation of S3 vectors are more basic structures.  

```{r S3-vectors, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Adapted from Advanced R, 2nd Edition", out.height='100%', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/S3-vectors.png")
```

###

### Factors, dates, and date-times 

The four types of atomic vectors (the basic data structure in R) are shown above. Factors, dates, and date-times are built using atomic vectors.

## Recreating R objects

In order to understand S3 structures, we'll be using the handy `dput()` function. 

`dput()` "*Writes an ASCII text representation of an R object.*" When we use `dput()` in `learnr` tutorials, the text representation of the object is printed in below the code block. 

###

We've created a date object (`vec_Date`). View the contents in the code block below. 

```{r prepare-vec_Date, include=FALSE}
tmrw <- Sys.time() + 86400
nxtyr <- Sys.time() + (86400*365)
centago <- Sys.time() - (86400*365*100)
# Date
vec_Date <- c(
  as.Date(x = tmrw, tz = "GMT"), 
  as.Date(x = nxtyr, tz = "GMT"), 
  as.Date(x = centago, tz = "GMT")
  )
rm(tmrw, nxtyr, centago)
```

```{r vec_Date, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-vec_Date", exercise.lines=5}
# View vec_Date

```

```{r vec_Date-solution}
# View vec_Date
vec_Date
```

```{r vec_Date-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

Now we'll use `dput()` to view how R 'recreates' this object. 

In the code block below: 

1. Pass the `vec_Date`  object to `dput()`  
2. View the output below the code block  

```{r prepare-dput, include=FALSE}
tmrw <- Sys.time() + 86400
nxtyr <- Sys.time() + (86400*365)
centago <- Sys.time() - (86400*365*100)
# Date
vec_Date <- c(
  as.Date(x = tmrw, tz = "GMT"), 
  as.Date(x = nxtyr, tz = "GMT"), 
  as.Date(x = centago, tz = "GMT")
  )
rm(tmrw, nxtyr, centago)
```


```{r Date_dput, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-dput", exercise.lines=2}
dput(____)

```

```{r Date_dput-solution}
dput(vec_Date)
```

```{r Date_dput-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

We can see the output from `dput(vec_Date)` tells us `vec_Date` is a vector comprised of three integers, of class `"Date"`. 

We can use the output from `dput()` to recreate the `vec_Date` object.

###

In the code block below: 

1. Copy the `vec_Date` output from `dput()` above and paste it below to recreate `vec_Date2` 
2. Print both vectors to the screen to check if these two objects are the same   

```{r recreate_vec_Date, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=6, exercise.setup = "prepare-dput"}
vec_Date2 <- 
# print vec_Date

# print vec_Date2

# is it identical to the original vec_Date?
```

###

In previous tutorials, we used `typeof()`, and `class()` to view the type and structure of R objects. `dput()` is a way to combine these functions (and it gives us the code to 'recreate' the object, which always comes in handy!)

## Factors 

Factors are S3 vectors which contain a distinct list of labels (or levels), and we can create factors with the `factor()` function. 

###

For example, `char_vector` is a character vector with a given set of responses: 

```{r char_vector, echo=TRUE}
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
char_vector
```

###

In the code block below: 

1. Convert `char_vector` to a factor with `factor()` function. 
2. Store the output in `fctr_vector` 
3. Print the results to the screen

```{r prepare-factor, echo=FALSE}
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
```

```{r fctr_vector, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="prepare-factor", exercise.lines=3}
____ <- factor(____)
# view results
```

```{r fctr_vector-solution}
fctr_vector <- factor(char_vector)
# view results
fctr_vector
```

```{r fctr_vector-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Factor levels 

We can see from the output from the previous exercise that factors have a new attribute: `Levels`. Factors automatically assign levels to categorical vectors based on alphabetical or numerical order.


###

In the code block below:

1. Check the levels of `fctr_vector` with `levels()`

```{r prepare-levels, include=FALSE}
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
fctr_vector <- factor(x = char_vector)
```

```{r levels, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-levels"}
# check the levels in fctr_vector
levels()
```

```{r levels-solution}
# check the levels in fctr_vector
levels(fctr_vector)
```

```{r levels-check}
# check the levels in fctr_vector
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

When we checked the levels of `fctr_vector`, we found the following: 

```
[1] "Always"    "Never"     "Sometimes"
```

But the correct order for the levels in `fctr_vector` should be:

`Never` < `Sometimes` < `Always`

### Setting factor levels 

We need to set the levels in `fctr_vector` in the correct order, which we can do with the `levels` argument. As we mentioned before, the levels are automatically assigned alphabetically (using unique values only).

```{r prepare-fctr_levels, include=FALSE}
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
```

###

In the code block below, 

1. Place the levels in the correct order and create the `fctr_levels` vector   
2. Create `fctr_vector` again, from `char_vector`, and assign it to the `levels` argument in `factor()`   
3. Confirm the new levels with the `levels()` function   

`Never` < `Sometimes` < `Always`

```{r fctr_levels, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-fctr_levels"}
# place levels in the correct order
fctr_levels <- c("", "", "")
# place fctr_levels in the levels argument 
fctr_vector <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                    levels = )
# confirm levels 
levels()
```

```{r fctr_levels-solution}
# place levels in the correct order
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")
# place fctr_levels in the levels argument 
fctr_vector <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                    levels = fctr_levels)
# confirm levels 
levels(fctr_vector)
```

```{r fctr_levels-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### The structure of factors 

We can check the structure of `fctr_vector` using `dput()`. 

###


In the code block below: 

1. Use `dput()` to see the structure of `fctr_vector` 

```{r prepare-fctr_levels-dput, include=FALSE}
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
# levels
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")
# fctr_levels
fctr_vector <- factor(x = char_vector, levels = fctr_levels)
```

```{r fctr_levels-dput, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-fctr_levels-dput"}
dput(____)
```

```{r fctr_levels-dput-solution}
dput(fctr_vector)
```

```{r fctr_levels-dput-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

The output of `dput()` tells us how R deals with with factors:

1. Each unique level value gets assigned an integer (in this case, 1-3)   
2. The levels have a corresponding `.Label` value (`c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")`)  
3. The class of `fctr_vector` (`class = "factor"`)   

Note that the integer values are printed in the order they were supplied in `char_vector`:

`c(2L, 1L, 3L)`

###

Print the `char_vector` to view the original order of the character vector:

```{r prepare-print-char_vector, include=FALSE}
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
```

```{r print-char_vector, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-print-char_vector"}
# check against the order in char_vector
char_vector
```

###

The output from the previous exercise is below:

`2L` = `"Sometimes"`, `1L` = `"Never"`, `3L` = `"Always"`

You should notice that the number of levels in a factor are distinct, so factors come in handy for character strings with specific and repeated categories. 

###

Consider the following character vectors: `mult_char_vector` and `fctr_levels`

```{r prepare-mult_char_vector, include=FALSE}
# mult_char_vector
mult_char_vector <- c("Never", "Always", "Sometimes", "Often",
                 "Always", "Rarely", "Often", "Rarely")
# fctr_levels (in order)
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")
```

We've created the following vectors in the code block below: 

```r
mult_char_vector <- c("Never", "Always", "Sometimes", "Often",
                 "Always", "Rarely", "Often", "Rarely")

fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")
```

###

In the code block below:

1. Examine the length of `mult_char_vector` and `fctr_levels`   
2. Create `fctr_mult_vector` by supplying `mult_char_vector` to factor, setting the levels with `fctr_levels`  
3. Check the structure of `fctr_mult_vector` (after supplying `mult_char_vector` and `fctr_levels` to `factor()`)   

```{r mult_char_vector, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-mult_char_vector"}
# check length() of mult_char_vector
length(____)
# check length() of fctr_levels
length(____)
# create fctr_mult_vector
____ <- factor(x = ____, 
                    levels = ____)
# check str() of fctr_mult_vector
str(____)
# How many levels are in fctr_mult_vector?
```

```{r mult_char_vector-solution}
# check length() of mult_char_vector
length(mult_char_vector)
# check length() of fctr_levels
length(fctr_levels)
# create fctr_mult_vector
fctr_mult_vector <- factor(x = mult_char_vector, 
                    levels = fctr_levels)
# check  str() of fctr_mult_vector
str(fctr_mult_vector)
# How many levels are in fctr_mult_vector?
```

```{r mult_char_vector-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

We can see that despite the `length()` of `mult_char_vector` being `8`, the number of levels in the `fctr_mult_vector` is constrained to `3` (the length of `fctr_levels`).

## Factor labels 

The `labels` argument can also be used to assign either 1) character values in the same order as the `levels`, or 2) a single character string that gets assigned a numerical suffix for each unique value of `levels`. 

###

Consider the vectors below:

```{r label_objects, echo=TRUE}
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
# fctr_levels
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")
# fctr_labels
fctr_labels <- c("NEVER", "SOMETIMES", "ALWAYS")
```

We have a character vector (`char_vector`), the levels in correct order (`fctr_levels`), and a set of labels (an uppercase version of the levels). 

###

In the code block below:

1. Create `fctr_with_levels` using the `char_vector` as `x` and `fctr_levels` as `levels`  
2. Create `fctr_with_labels` using the `char_vector` as `x`, `fctr_levels` as `levels`, and `fctr_labels` as `labels`  

```{r prepare-labels}
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
# fctr_levels
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")
# fctr_labels
fctr_labels <- c("NEVER", "SOMETIMES", "ALWAYS")
```

```{r labels, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-labels", exercise.lines=9}
# create fctr_with_levels
_____levels <- factor(x = _____, 
                      levels = _____)
# create fctr_with_labels
_____labels <- factor(x = _____,
                      levels = _____,
                      labels = _____)

```

```{r labels-solution}
# create fctr_with_levels
fctr_with_levels <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                    levels = fctr_levels)
# create fctr_with_labels
fctr_with_labels <- factor(x = char_vector,
                    levels = fctr_levels,
                    labels = fctr_labels)
```

```{r labels-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```


### Changing factor labels 

Use the code block below to review the `fctr_with_labels`

```{r prepare-fctr_with_labels}
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
# fctr_levels
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")
# fctr_labels
fctr_labels <- c("NEVER", "SOMETIMES", "ALWAYS")
# create fctr_with_labels
fctr_with_labels <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                    levels = fctr_levels,
                    labels = fctr_labels)
```


```{r fctr_with_labels, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-fctr_with_labels", exercise.lines=4}
# view the fctr_with_labels with dput
# dput()
```

```{r fctr_with_labels-solution}
dput(fctr_with_labels)
```

```{r fctr_with_labels-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

As we can see, the `levels` values in the `fctr_with_labels` factor has changed to the uppercase values.

###

When we print the vector we see the factor values have also been converted to uppercase (and the values are in the same order as the original character vector). 

```{r prep-print-char_vector-fctr_with_labels, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
# fctr_levels
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")
# fctr_labels
fctr_labels <- c("NEVER", "SOMETIMES", "ALWAYS")
# create fctr_with_labels
fctr_with_labels <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                    levels = fctr_levels,
                    labels = fctr_labels)
```

```{r print-char_vector-fctr_with_labels, echo=TRUE}
# factor with new labels
fctr_with_labels
# original character vector 
char_vector
```

###

We're going to replace the uppercase labels with a single text string to demonstrate how this works. 

###

In the code block below:

1. Create `fctr_chr_string` using `char_vector` as `x`, `fctr_levels` as `levels`, and `chr_string` as `labels`

```{r prepare-chr_string, echo=FALSE}
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
# fctr_levels
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")
# character string length 1
chr_string <- c("FACTOR LABEL ")
# create fctr_chr_string
fctr_chr_string <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                      levels = fctr_levels, 
                      labels = chr_string)
```

```{r chr_string, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="prepare-chr_string", exercise.lines=7}
# character string length 1
chr_string <- c("FACTOR LABEL ")
# create fctr_chr_string
____ <- factor(x = ____, 
                      levels = ____, 
                      labels = ____)
```

```{r chr_string-solution}
# character string length 1
chr_string <- c("FACTOR LABEL ")
# create fctr_chr_string
fctr_chr_string <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                      levels = fctr_levels, 
                      labels = chr_string)
```

```{r chr_string-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

Use the code block below to print the `fctr_chr_string` you've created above. The `fctr_vector` and original `char_vector` are also available for comparison. 

```{r prepare-fctr_chr_string, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
# fctr_levels
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")
# character string length 1
chr_string <- c("FACTOR LABEL ")
# create fctr_chr_string
fctr_chr_string <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                      levels = fctr_levels, 
                      labels = chr_string)
```

```{r review_fctr_with_labels, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-fctr_chr_string",  exercise.lines=3}
# print the fctr_chr_string

```

###

The `fctr_chr_string` factor has replaced the original values from `char_vector` (printed below) with the character string we provided to the labels argument, and 'pasted' a numerical suffix as an identifier. The order of the values hasn't changed (as we can see if we use the `deput()` function on `fctr_chr_string` in the code chunk above): 

*The order of the values:* 

    c(2L, 1L, 3L)

###

*The order of `fctr_chr_string`:*

```r
## [1] "FACTOR LABEL 2" "FACTOR LABEL 1" "FACTOR LABEL 3"
```
    
###


*The original character values (for reference):*

```{r print-char_vector_02}
char_vector
```

## Ordered factors 

Sometimes it's necessary to force the factor levels into a specific order, which we can do by setting `ordered` to `TRUE`. 

###

Use the code block below:

1. Create `fct_ordered` with `char_vector` and `fctr_levels`  
2. Print `fctr_levels` and use `dput()` to investigate it's structure  

```{r prepare-fct_ordered, include=FALSE}
# char_vector
char_vector <- c("Sometimes", "Never", "Always")
# fctr_levels
fctr_levels <- c("Never", "Sometimes", "Always")
```

###

```{r fct_ordered, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-fct_ordered"}
# create fct_ordered
fct_ordered <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                      levels = fctr_levels, 
                      ordered = )
# print fct_ordered 

# dput() fct_ordered

# What is different about the structure of fct_ordered?
```

```{r fct_ordered-solution}
# create fct_ordered
fct_ordered <- factor(x = char_vector, 
                      levels = fctr_levels, 
                      ordered = TRUE)
# print fct_ordered 
fct_ordered
# dput() fct_ordered
dput(fct_ordered)
# What is different about the structure of fct_ordered?
```

```{r fct_ordered-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

As we can see, `fct_ordered` has an additional class (`class = c("ordered", "factor")`). Ordered factors are helpful whenever you have a variable with ranked categories (i.e., `high` - `medium` - `low`).

## Dates 

We're going to cover three date formats in R: `"Date"`, `"POSIXlt"` and `"POSIXct"`

###

### ISO-8601

Dates come in a variety of formats, but only one correct format, and that's the [ISO-8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), or `YYYY-MM-DD`. 

Date storage formats have become such an issue, there's even an xkcd comic about it: 

```{r iso_8601.png, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/iso_8601.png")
```

###

The `as.Date()` function converts character vectors into a date vector, provided we supply the dates in the ISO-8601 (`YYYY-MM-DD`) format. 

###

In the code block below:

1. Create the `date_vector` from `string_dates` 
2. View it's structure with `dput()`

```{r date_vector, exercise=TRUE}
# character string of dates 
string_dates <- c("1800-01-01", "1920-11-05", "2020-06-26")
# create date_vector
date_vector <- as.Date(x = ____)
# check the structure with dput()
dput(____)
```

```{r date_vector-solution}
# character string of dates 
string_dates <- c("1800-01-01", "1920-11-05", "2020-06-26")
# create date_vector
date_vector <- as.Date(x = string_dates)
# check the structure with dput()
dput(date_vector)
```

```{r date_vector-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

As we can see from the output above, dates are integers (`c(-62091, -17954, 18439)`) with `class = "Date"`. 

## Date-times (`POSIX`)

R also comes with a few handy functions for date-times (data objects with `YYYY-MM-DD` and  `HH:MM:SS TZ`). The `Sys.Date()` and `Sys.time()` functions gives us our system's current date or date-time.

###

### Create Date-times 

In the code block below: 

1. Use the `Sys.Date()` function to create `current_date`   
1. Use the `Sys.Time()` function to create `current_datetime`   
3. Print each of them to the screen to view their contents  

```{r SysDate-Systime, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=8}
# current_date
current_date <- Sys.Date()
# current date-time
current_datetime <- Sys.time()
# print to screen 

# print to screen

```

###

Notice the difference in formats: 

###

- `Sys.Date()` creates a date in format `"YYYY-MM-DD"`  

###

- `Sys.time()` creates a date in format `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ"` 

###

The `current_date` and `current_datetime` vectors have been created again in the code block below. Explore their contents with `dput()`:

```{r prepare-current_date-current_datetime, include=FALSE}
# current_date
current_date <- Sys.Date()
# current_datetime
current_datetime <- Sys.time()
```

```{r current_date-current_time, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-current_date-current_datetime"}
# explore current_date with dput()

# explore current_datetime with dput()

# How does R create dates?
```

###

As you can see, these are stored as two different classes: 

- `Sys.Date()` creates date with `"Date"` class  
- `Sys.time()` creates a date with two classes, `"POSIXct"`/`"POSIXt"`  

###

*What's the difference?*

Both classes have numeric values. These values are related to the [UNIX Epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), which is January 1, 1970 (00:00:00 UTC).

```{r waldo, include=FALSE}
time_01 <- unclass(as.POSIXct(x = Sys.time(), tz = "GMT"))
time_02 <- unclass(as.POSIXct(x = Sys.time(), tz = "GMT"))
waldo::compare(x = time_01, y = time_02)
```

###

The UNIX Epoch serves as a fixed point in time the computer uses to calculate dates *from*. The actual date and time is arbitrary, but without a point in time to start from, there's no way to quantify or measure a 'date.' 

For the `"Date"` class, the number represents the number of days since the epoch, and for the `"POSIXct"`/`"POSIXlt"` classes, this represents the number of seconds (to the nearest second) since the epoch. 

###

The `"POSIXct"`/`"POSIXlt"` classes also both contain a time-zone (explore your system's time-zone with `Sys.timezone(location = TRUE)`).

###

In the code block below we'll use some of R's built-in functions to explore basic arithmetic with dates. 

1. Create current_date using `Sys.Date()`  
2. Use `as.numeric()` to get the number of days/seconds since the epoch. Store this in `days_since_epoch`  
3. Convert the epoch date (`"1970-01-01"`) to a date and add the `days_since_epoch` vector

In both examples, it should return today's date. 

```{r days_since_epoch, exercise=TRUE}
# current date
current_date <- ____()
# extract days 
days_since_epoch <- as.numeric(____)
# convert to date and add days since epoch
____("1970-01-01") + ____
```

```{r days_since_epoch-solution}
# current date
current_date <- Sys.Date()
# extract days 
days_since_epoch <- as.numeric(current_date)
# convert to date and add days  since epoch
as.Date("1970-01-01") + days_since_epoch
```

```{r days_since_epoch-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

This brings us up to the current date. Now let's see what happens when we do the same thing with `Sys.time()`. 

###

In the code block below: 

1. Create `current_time` using `Sys.time()`  
2. Use `as.numeric()` to get the number of days/seconds since the epoch. Store this in `secs_since_epoch`  
3. Convert the epoch date (`"1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC"`) to a date and add the `secs_since_epoch` vector

In both examples, it should return today's date. 

```{r secs_since_epoch, exercise=TRUE}
# current time
current_time <- ____
# extract seconds
secs_since_epoch <- as.numeric(____)
# convert to date and add seconds
____("1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC") + 
```

```{r secs_since_epoch-solution}
# current time
current_time <- Sys.time()
# extract seconds
secs_since_epoch <- as.numeric(current_time)
# convert to date and add seconds
as.POSIXct("1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC") + secs_since_epoch
```

```{r secs_since_epoch-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

Once again, we're brought up to the current date. 

### `as.POSIXct()` vs. `as.POSIXlt()`

We're gong to explore the differences between `as.POSIXct()` and `as.POSIXlt()`. Both of these functions create date-time objects, but the resulting structures are slightly different. The `ct` and `lt` stand for **"character time"** and **"list time"**.   

###

In the code block below, we've created three character dates to demonstrate these differences:

```{r datetime_vectors, echo=TRUE}
# date
vec_ymd <- "2014-08-24"
# date and time
vec_ymd_hms <- "2014-08-24 15:11:23"
# date, time, and timezone
vec_ymd_hms_tz <- "2014-08-24 15:11:23 US/Pacific"
```


```{r prepare-datetime_vectors, include=FALSE}
# date
vec_ymd <- "2014-08-24"
# date and time
vec_ymd_hms <- "2014-08-24 15:11:23"
# date, time, and timezone
vec_ymd_hms_tz <- "2014-08-24 15:11:23 US/Pacific"
```

###

In the code blocks below: 

1. Pass each vector to `as.POSIXct()` and `dput()`

```{r asPOSIXct_01, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-datetime_vectors"}
dput(
  as.POSIXct(x = ) # pass vec_ymd to x
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXct_01-solution}
dput(
  as.POSIXct(x = vec_ymd) 
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXct_01-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

```{r asPOSIXct_02, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-datetime_vectors"}
dput(
  as.POSIXct(x = ) # pass vec_ymd_hms to x
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXct_02-solution}
dput(
  as.POSIXct(x = vec_ymd_hms) 
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXct_02-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

```{r asPOSIXct_03, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-datetime_vectors"}
dput(
  as.POSIXct(x = ) # pass vec_ymd_hms_tz to x
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXct_03-solution}
dput(
  as.POSIXct(x = vec_ymd_hms_tz)
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXct_03-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

As we can see, these all share the same structure--they are vectors with an integer and two classes (`class = c("POSIXct", "POSIXt")`) and an optional timezone (`tzone = ""`). 

###

You may have also noticed that only thing that changes is the integer value when we add `hh:mm:ss` in `vec_ymd_hms` and `vec_ymd_hms_tz`.

###

Now we'll repeat this process with `as.POSIXlt()`

In the code block below: 

1. Pass each vector to `as.POSIXlt()` and `dput()`

```{r asPOSIXlt_01, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-datetime_vectors"}
dput(
  as.POSIXlt(x = ) # pass vec_ymd to x
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXlt_01-solution}
dput(
  as.POSIXlt(x = vec_ymd) 
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXlt_01-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

```{r asPOSIXlt_02, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-datetime_vectors"}
dput(
  as.POSIXlt(x = ) # pass vec_ymd_hms to x
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXlt_02-solution}
dput(
  as.POSIXlt(x = vec_ymd_hms) 
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXlt_02-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```


```{r asPOSIXlt_03, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-datetime_vectors"}
dput(
  as.POSIXlt(x = ) # pass vec_ymd_hms_tz to x
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXlt_03-solution}
dput(
  as.POSIXlt(x = vec_ymd_hms_tz)
  )
```

```{r asPOSIXlt_03-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

The first thing we see about the structure returned by `as.POSIXlt()` is that it's a `list()` containing all the individual components of a date-time object (`sec`, `min`, `hour`, `mday`, `mon`, `year`, `wday`, `yday`, `isdst`, `zone`, and `gmmtoff`). It also has two classes: `class = c("POSIXlt", "POSIXt")`. 

###

We won't dive into what each of these values represent (it's in the help file you can access using `??as.POSIXlt`), but you should notice it's a *lot* more information than the resulting structure of `as.POSIXct()`. In the `tidyverse`, we will be using the [`lubridate` package](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/) to handle dates and times (but we won't cover that here).

## Difftimes 

`difftimes` are calculated from date-time or date vectors and stored in their own class (`difftime`). 

<br>

```{r S3-difftimes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Adapted from Advanced R, 2nd Edition", out.height='100%', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "www/S3-difftimes.png")
```

###

Now that we've know how to create dates with `Sys.time()` and `Sys.Date()`, we can use these functions to calculate the difference between them. 

###

The function for creating the distance between two time-points is `difftime()`, and it takes the following arguments:

```r
difftime(time1 = , time2 = , units = )
```

###

We've used the `Sys.time()` function in previous exercises to create a date-time object. You'll use this function below to create `time1` and `time2` (from above) to calculate a `difftime` object.  

###

Use the code block below to create two dates 

1. `last_year`: `Sys.time()` minus 1 year 
2. `two_years_ago`: `Sys.time()` minus 2 years 

*Tip:* the `Sys.time()` uses seconds as units, and there are `86400` seconds in one day. 

```{r difftime_dates, exercise=TRUE}
last_year <- Sys.time() - _____
two_years_ago <- Sys.time() - ____
```

```{r difftime_dates-solution}
last_year <- Sys.time() - (86400*365)
two_years_ago <- Sys.time() - 2*(86400*365)
```

```{r difftime_dates-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

Great! Now use the `last_year` and `two_years_ago` vectors with `difftime()` to get the duration in `"days"`.  

```{r prepare-difftime, include=FALSE}
last_year <- Sys.time() - (86400*365)
two_years_ago <- Sys.time() - 2*(86400*365)
```

```{r difftime, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=7, exercise.setup = "prepare-difftime"}
# calculate the difftime in "days"
vec_difftime <- difftime(
                  time1 = , 
                  time2 = , 
                  units = "")
# print vec_difftime

```

```{r difftime-solution}
# calculate the difftime in "days"
vec_difftime <- difftime(
                  time1 = last_year, 
                  time2 = two_years_ago, 
                  units = "days")
# print vec_difftime
vec_difftime
```

```{r difftime-check}
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

###

We can see this tells us the number of days between `last_year` and `two_years_ago`.

###

In the code block below:

Use the `dput()` function to recreate the `difftime` object.  

```{r prepare-difftime-dput, include=FALSE}
last_year <- Sys.time() - (86400*365)
two_years_ago <- Sys.time() - 2*(86400*365)
vec_difftime <- difftime(time1 = last_year, 
                         time2 = two_years_ago, 
                         units = "days")
```

```{r difftime-dput, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup = "prepare-difftime-dput"}
# check vec_difftime with dput()
dput()
# how does R create difftimes?
```

###

We can see the structure of `vec_difftime` contains the numeric value (`364.999999972872`, not *quite* 365, but we'll round up), it's class (`class = "difftime"`), and the units (`units = "days"`).

## Conclusion 

In these exercises, we've covered: 

- Recreating R objects 
  + `dput()`
- Factors (`factor(x = , levels = , labels = , ordered = )`)
  + `levels` = setting levels in correct order 
  + `labels` = changing labels 
  + `ordered` = ordering factor levels 
- Dates 
  - `as.Date(x = )`
- Datetimes  
  + `as.POSIXct(x = , tz = )`  
  + `as.POSIXlt(x = , tz = )`  
- Difftimes  
  + `difftime(time1 = , time2 = , units = )`
